## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for React)
- Python and pip (for Django)
- virtualenv (for managing Python dependencies)

### Installing

#### Backend Setup

1. Create a project directory and navigate into it:


2. Install virtualenv and create a virtual environment:


3. Install Django and start the project:


4. Run the Django server: `python manage.py runserver`



#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate back to the project root directory and create the React app:


2. Install Tailwind and SkeltonUi for styling:


3. Start the React development server: `npm start`


## Running the Application

- **Backend**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `python manage.py runserver`.
- **Frontend**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`.

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` for the React frontend and `http://localhost:8000` for the Django backend.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) - Simple React material ui components.
- [Threejs](https://threejs.org/) - Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
